Repository of Keyboard Maestro macros

These are some of the Keyboard Maestro macros I use on my Mac to automate common processes.

# Recognize text in images on desktop
- This Macro will monitor the desktop folder and when it finds a screenshot image it will run the built-in Keyboard Maestro OCR command and store the results in the comments to increase spotlight searchability. Covers English, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.
